// GROUND ORDERING ============================================
// NOTE: DO *NOT* PUT GROUND DATA HERE.
// this is where the ground order is defined.
// ============================================================
// You can generate ground data by opening GRAPHICS/cube.nss
// in NEXXT and making a ground in the nametable space. The
// ground design should use Palette 1 and take the lowest six
// tiles of the nametable builder. To export, go to
// File > Canvas > Save as Screen (32x30), and select
// "RLE C header (.h)."
//
// Put the contents of the file in grounddata.h, and then put
// the name of the ground in the pointer list below.
// ============================================================

const unsigned char * const ground[] = {ground0};
