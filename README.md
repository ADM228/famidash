## contributing

``TODO proper guide``

Here are some instructions for specifically contributing to [levels](LEVELS/EXPORT%20LEVELS%20INSTRUCTIONS.txt) and [music](MUSIC/README.txt).

The general principle is: fork it, change it, push it, open a PR, get it merged (or not).

*(usersniper recommends working on the game using vscode on linux)*
