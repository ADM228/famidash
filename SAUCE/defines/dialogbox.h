    Escape characters:
    \a  - Include a substring (its address has to have been pushed to the C stack)
    \b  - Replaces the entire line with Black BG characters, rewinds to the beginning
    \n  - Jumps to the beginning of the next line
    \t  - Skip the next few characters, the byte right after this indicates the amount
    \0 (automatically done by cc65) - End of string
